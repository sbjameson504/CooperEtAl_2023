# epgHz 

This is an adapted version of the findPeaks method (below) that has been tailored for electropenetrography (EPG) waveforms. The script takes a WinDaq .csv file, normalizes the data, trims it to the desired section, and then uses the findPeaks method to calculate the number of peaks in this region (conventionally reported as hertz (Hz). 

The initial version of this script (reported in [citation]) uses differing cutoff values by waveform to approximate reported Hz measurements for each waveform. Cutoff values used for each waveform are reported in a separate file. 

The hope is that this method may help direct critical analysis of the calculating and reporting of Hz for EPG waveforms. Overtime, the goal is to move to more standardized and mathematically-defined methods and a more precise "peaks per second" metric.

# findPeaks

A repo for a function I posted as part of my answer to a [quesiton about peak detection](http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/22974/how-to-find-local-peaks-valleys-in-a-series-of-data/164830#164830) on StackExchange.

The function takes an ordered sequence (vector) of values `x` and a number `m` and returns a vector of indices of local peaks in `x`. A (local) peak is defined as a point such that `m` points either side of it has a lower or equal value to it. Thus, `m`  can be used adjust the sensitivity of the peak detection procedure: larger `m` will result in fewer peaks, whilst smaller values of `m` will result in more peaks found. 

## Example
```r
set.seed(321)
w <- abs(rnorm(1000))
w[sample(1 : 1000, 25)] <- rpois(25, 5) #adding small random peaks
w[sample(1 : 1000, 25)] <- rpois(25, 10) #adding big random peaks

par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
for(k in c(10, 20, 50, 250)){
	p <- find_peaks(w, m = k)
	plot(w, type = 'l', main = paste0('m = ', k))
	points(p, w[p], col = 'red', pch = 19)
}
```

## Finding valleys (local minima)

To fnd local minima of a sequence `x` apply the functions to `-x` (as the peaks of the negative of the sequence are precisely valleys of the original sequence).

```r
set.seed(321)
w <- rnorm(1000)
w[sample(1 : 1000, 25)] <- ifelse(runif(25) > 0.5, 1, -1) * rpois(25, 5) #adding small random peaks/valleys (roughly 50/50)
w[sample(1 : 1000, 25)] <- ifelse(runif(25) > 0.5, 1, -1) * rpois(25, 5) #adding big random peaks/valleys (roughly 50/50)

par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
for(k in c(10, 20, 50, 250)){
	p1 <- find_peaks(w, m = k) #finding peaks
	p2 <- find_peaks(-w, m = k) #finding valleys
	p <- c(p1, p2) #combining the two
	plot(w, type = 'l', main = paste0('m = ', k))
	points(p, w[p], col = c(rep('red', length(p1)), rep('blue', length(p2))), pch = 19)
}
```
